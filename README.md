go-lang-example-wiki-app
========================

Go language example wiki app. 

The basic branch is based on the excellent Go lang tutorial for web services at: http://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/ 

The master branch is modified to be deployable to Google's App Engine.

This is meant to be a reference for myself in the future. Use parts of this code at your own risk.
